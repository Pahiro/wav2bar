    <h1>Install FFmpeg and FFprobe in Wav2Bar</h1>

    <h2>Why is FFmpeg not installed with Wav2Bar ?</h2>
    <p>
        For legal reasons, it is complicated to ship FFmpeg with wa2bar packages while dealing
        with legal restrictions. That's why you need to install it manually. But don't worry,
        it's not very much complicated, this page is here to guide you!
    </p>

    <h2>Why do I need FFmpeg and FFprobe ?</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>To export your work as a video</strong>, an encoding executable is required. FFmpeg and FFprobe are the executables
        that do that job. FFmpeg is known world wide for it's reliability, flexbility and speed, and is used in many
        popular open source softwares such as Blender or Audacity. So don't worry, it's not a virus!

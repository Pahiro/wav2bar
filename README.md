# Audio Visualizer Creator
A tool to make custom audio visualization and export production videos for the music industry.

### Important Notes
- **This tool is usable at this point, but is still in early development! Video export DO NOT work. The use of this software is subject to bugs, backup your saves!**
- This tool uses Electron 6 and so run in a Chrome clone locally. This code cannot be runned in the browser as it contains Electron code! A browser version may be considered.

### Running
- NodeJS must be installed (It will install npm too).
- Git is recommended.
- Open the repository folder in a prompt and run `npm start`.
- No compilation required, it cannot be compiled too.

### About the broken video export
~~I am having issues collecting frequency data at non real-time as the Web Audio API is not made for that.
I may have workarounds, however **if you think you have any help to provide to move forward and fix it, please reach me at picorims.contact@gmail.com!**. Beside this issue, the rest of the video basic export is fully working.~~
I may have found a solution that I will try later.

# Wav2Bar
A tool to make custom audio visualization and export production videos for the audio/music industry.

## Important Notes
- **This tool is usable at this point, but is still in early development! Your work is subject to bugs, backup your saves!**

## Hacking
- NodeJS must be installed (It will install npm too).
- Clone the git repository (you can also use GitHub's download button *if you only need to perform tests*). Note that Git LFS is used!
- Mac/linux:
    - Reinstall the same version of Electron, the repository contains a Windows 64bit version of it.
    - download FFmpeg for your operating system and configure it in the app settings (otherwise export won't work!).
- Open the repository folder in a prompt and run `npm start`.
